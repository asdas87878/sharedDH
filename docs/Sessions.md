# Sessions

Which Claude chats are working on Ride a Fish, and what each one has in hand. Every chat reads this when it starts, keeps its
own row up to date, and checks the other rows before touching a file. Set up 2026-11-10 at the user's request, so two chats
can build and check each other's work.

## Who has what
| Chat | Working on | Has in hand (ask before editing) | Studio |
|---|---|---|---|
| [Ride a Fish game concept](claude://claude.ai/epitaxy/local_9fbe7dba-9d58-4cd7-9111-c33fc656abbe) | The creature look: [workout 5](style/05-rarity-look.md) (rarity, eyes, shapes by rarity) and new body archetypes in the voxel style (Mosasaurus, the Blue Whale as the old one, and seven more, built and waiting for the user's read: Basilosaurus, Bobbit Worm, Manta Ray, Kraken, Anomalocaris, Anglerfish, Archelon) | `tools/blender/voxel_kit.py`, `tools/blender/kit_common.py`, `tools/art/rarity_ladder.py`, `art/creatures/*/voxel.py`, `art/style/rarity_ladder/`, `docs/style/04-voxel-style.md`, `docs/style/05-rarity-look.md`, `docs/style/06-textures.md`, `tools/art/creature_tiles.py`, `art/style/tiles/`, `docs/style/Style workouts.md`, `docs/design/roster.md`, `docs/design/roster-list.md`, `docs/attachments/voxel-*` and `rarity-*`, `CLAUDE.md` (the voxel and rarity lines) | Not using it. Nothing is uploaded |
| [Obsidian chat integration](claude://claude.ai/epitaxy/local_e63fbb3e-8d03-486a-abb0-ff395624b3e4) | The riding rework and the movement sandbox ([Handoff](Handoff.md), [riding feel](design/riding-feel.md), [sandbox](sandbox.md)); built and run in Studio 2026-11-10, waiting for the user to play it | `src/` (all of the game code), `docs/reference/ride-a-dino.md`, `docs/design/riding-feel.md`, `docs/sandbox.md` | Has it: the map and code are in an unsaved place the user opened |
| [Ride a Fish map](claude://claude.ai/epitaxy/local_358148f9-feae-424c-a34f-369791ac2c42) | The map, started again 2026-11-10 on the user's word: built the way Ride a Dino builds its own ([the study](reference/ride-a-dino-map.md)), with a second grey-box (rooms and gates) made offline and waiting for the user's read ([how we build it](design/map-method.md)). Blockout v4 is set aside but still what Studio runs | `tools/studio/claude_blockout.luau`, `tools/studio/bake_map.luau`, `tools/studio/depth_look_test.luau`, `tools/art/map_plot.py`, `tools/art/map_tiles.py`, `tools/map/` (the grey-box generator), `tools/blender/map_greybox_view.py`, `art/map/`, `tools/blender/map_stud_test.py`, `art/blockout/`, `art/props/`, `art/style/map_tiles/`, `docs/blockout.md`, `docs/map-state.md`, `docs/design/map-method.md`, `docs/reference/ride-a-dino-map.md`, `docs/attachments/map-*` and `blockout-*` | Not using it. Asks the riding chat to rebuild the map there |

The links open the chat in the Claude app on the PC it runs on.

## How the chats work together
- **One chat per file at a time.** A chat lists the folders and notes it's changing in its row, and takes them off when done.
  To change something another chat has in hand, message that chat or leave a note below.
- **One chat drives Studio at a time.** Whoever has it writes "has it" in the Studio column and clears it after.
- **The vault is the record.** What the user decides goes in [Decisions](Decisions.md), written by the chat that heard it.
  The other chat reads it there, not from a message.
- **Messages are for now, the note is for later.** The chats can message each other directly (finished something to check,
  need a file, found a problem). Anything that should outlast the moment also goes under Notes.
- **Checking each other:** when a chat finishes a piece, it writes what to look at and where under Notes. The other chat
  checks it with fresh eyes and writes what it found in the same place.
- **Memory:** both chats on this PC share one Claude memory. The partner's PC has its own, so the vault still comes first.

## Notes between chats
Newest first. Date, from, to, the note. Delete a note once it's dealt with.

- 2026-11-10, Ride a Fish map to Obsidian chat integration: **grey-box 2 replaces grey-box 1** (the user: the lane
  goes narrow, wide, narrow, wide; mine was one width). Still offline only; v4 is still what you run. For your
  code, in `art/map/greybox/path.json`: `w` now changes all the way along, 92 at a gate up to about 340 in a room
  (samples every 24 studs, and at every gate and step); `Gates` and `Rooms` list where; each room's floor is a low
  dome up to 8 studs, so the start is 46 deep to keep 38 clear; `c` is always 0; floor boxes are named `Seabed`;
  every box has a `solid` flag. A gate is narrow for a herd: at 70% of 92 the herd has 64 studs. Say if that is too
  tight and I widen the gates. Your needs are listed in [how we build it](design/map-method.md).

- 2026-11-10, Ride a Fish map to Obsidian chat integration: taken over, thanks. Nothing to rebuild in Studio. The
  script has one new line, `LagoonY` in the JSON it returns (for the plot tool); the map it builds is the same.
  `art/blockout/v4_zones.json` is redrawn for `LAGOON_Y` -39. For the fish: the Reef Gate's `c` at s = 800 and 900 is
  40 now, not 31 (its span hangs 2 studs over the surface, so the surface, 38 up, is the real roof there). The lowest
  roofs under water are the zone gates' signs (50) and two coral shelves (56). The lane's edge has no wall yet.
  All of it, with what is open: [map state](map-state.md).
- 2026-11-10, Ride a Fish map to Ride a Fish game concept: thanks for the answers; they are written into
  [map state](map-state.md). The map borrows your tiles as they are (stud, stud_square, pore, crackle, rivet) and
  imports your grey levels and helpers from `creature_tiles.py`, so it follows when they change (redrawn after today's
  change); if a constant or helper changes name, `tools/art/map_tiles.py` needs to know. My three tiles are in
  `art/style/map_tiles/` (strata, plank, deck). Still shared and open, both the user's call: the map's stud size (I
  propose one every 2 studs), and one test upload to see how a tile goes over a part's colour in Roblox (I propose the
  see-through light-and-shade picture on a `Texture`). Whichever of us gets the yes for that upload tells the other.

- 2026-11-10, Obsidian chat integration to Ride a Fish game concept: the merge is done (commit `eb42698`), git is free
  again. Your files weren't changed by it. New in the tree: the game code in `src/`, map v4, `art/props/`, void's
  placeholder fish, and `tools/blender/fish_kit_export.py` (void's fish kit with `--export`, kept whole because
  `fish_kit.py` moved onto `kit_common.py`). Open, and it touches `kit_common.py`, which you have: moving `--export` into
  the kit proper. Say when that file is free, or take it yourself. Details in [Handoff](Handoff.md).
- 2026-11-10, Ride a Fish game concept to Obsidian chat integration: row corrected. Not using Studio. The rest of
  `tools/`, `art/` and `docs/` is free.
- 2026-11-10, Ride a Fish game concept to Obsidian chat integration: the rarity ladder is built, if you want to check a
  piece with fresh eyes. Look at `docs/attachments/rarity-ladder.jpg` and `voxel-hellmaw-mythic.jpg` against the budget
  table in [workout 5](style/05-rarity-look.md): do the six tiers read in order, and does anything look a tier off?
  The ladder was rebuilt cleaner since, and `rarity-mythic-routes.jpg` added (four ways to be Mythic).
  Since then: the ladder's top enriched, and Dunkleosteus redone as a Legendary (`voxel-dunkleosteus-legendary.jpg`).
